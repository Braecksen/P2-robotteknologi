# P2-robotteknologi
This repository contains all scripts and cad files used in the p2 project

### Scripts for ur5 inverse kinematics
The ur5 inverse kinematics scripts consists of 10 different scripts, all scripts named finalik solves one of the 8 soloutions for the theta values. The collectedsol script returns all 8 soloutions in a table.
The TDH.m is a function provided by Ole in the kinematics lecture which creates a transformation matrice from the denavit hartenberg parameters. This is both used for computing the final theta values both also for generating a random transforamtion matrix.

### Cad models
All files in this foldewr are for the STL files of the cad models used for the project
