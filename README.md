# P2-robotteknologi
This repository contains all scripts and cad files used in the p2 project

### Scripts for ur5 inverse kinematics
The ur5 inverse kinematics scripts consists of 10 different scripts, all scripts named finalik solves one of the 8 soloutions for the theta values. The collectedsol script returns all 8 soloutions in a table.
The TDH.m is a function provided by Ole in the kinematics lecture which creates a transformation matrice from the denavit hartenberg parameters. This is both used for computing the final theta values but also for generating a random transforamtion matrix.

### Script for UR5 forward kinematics
This folder contains the scripts for the ur5 forward kinematics


### Cad models
All files in this folder are for the STL files of the cad models used for the project


### TDH.m
this is the file for creating a transformation matrice from the denavit hartenberg parameters, it is also nneded for computing inverse kinematics.
